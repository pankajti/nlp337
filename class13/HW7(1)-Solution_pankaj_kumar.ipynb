than his real life original probably was we see little of his <UNK> and <UNK> about political matters truman 's remark he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about <UNK> was said about <UNK> but it could equally well have been applied to <UNK> approach to international <UNK> perhaps the film's attempt to paint out some of <UNK> <UNK> reflects the period in which it was made the late

is not covered at all the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the <UNK> one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general <UNK> father himself a military hero i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on <UNK> clash with truman with equal <UNK> given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches br br it would be wrong however to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether although i may not have agreed with <UNK> interpretation of the main role there is no denying that he played it with his normal <UNK> and seriousness the film as a whole is a good example of a solid <UNK> biopic thoughtful and informative it is a good film but one that could have been a better one 7 10 br br on a <UNK> note the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the <UNK> the <UNK> between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war the pre war <UNK> was the <UNK> parallel also i think that macarthur was referring to the <UNK> of
